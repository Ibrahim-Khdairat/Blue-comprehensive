He has a history\nof previous myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, and pneumonia. He\nhas an A-line, pulmonary artery (PA) catheter and is receiving oxygen by nasal\ncannula.

    ],
    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "explanation": "Cardiac output is determined by four main factors: preload, afterload,\nmyocardial contractility, and heart rate. An intravascular fluid challenge is\nfrequently used to increase preload and cardiac output. Preload refers to the\namount of stretch of the cardiac muscle at the start of systole and is indirectly\ndetermined by the pressure in the ventricle (an increase in pressure usually\nmeans increase to stretch, unless there is a cardiac tamponade, which prevents\nthe heart from filling). Afterload refers to the resistance in blood flow from the\nventricle as determined by the aortic valve or arterial resistance. Contractility\nrefers to the measurement of force the cardiac muscle can generate.\nA PA catheter is often placed to measure the CVP, PA pressure, and wedge\npressure, and can determine the cardiac output (usually by thermodilution).\nThe CVP measures the filling pressure for the right ventricle, and the PA\nocclusion or wedge pressure measures the filling pressure for the left ventricle.\nTEE can be used to look at the size of the ventricular chambers and how well\nthey contract (e.g., ejection fraction).\nWhen a patient is receiving positive pressure ventilation, measurement of PPV\nor systolic pressure variation (SPV) can be done. When positive pressure is\napplied to the lungs during mechanical ventilation (i.e., during inspiration),\nvenous return to the right side of the heart and right ventricle stroke volume is\nreduced, decreasing cardiac output and systolic BP. Pulse pressure is the\ndifference between systolic and diastolic BPs. PPV is defined as the pulse\npressure between breaths (PPmax) minus the pulse pressure during positive\npressure ventilation (PPmin) divided by the mean pulse pressure (PPmax +\nPPmin/2) times 100%. For example, if the PPmax is 90 (systolic BP 160,\ndiastolic 70) and the PPmin is 70 (systolic BP 130, diastolic 60) then the PPV\n= (90 - 70)/80 = 25%. Patients are considered fluid responsive (i.e., an increase\nin BP or cardiac output) if the PPV is > 15% and not fluid responsive if the\nPPV is < 7%. Alternatively, SPV, which is the difference in systolic BP during\ninspiration (positive intrathoracic pressure) and expiration, can be determined,\nwith normal values of 7 to 10 mm Hg. Hypovolemic patients have an elevation\nin SPV. Patients with an SPV > 10 mm Hg are fluid responsive, whereas those\nwith an SPV < 5 mm Hg are not fluid responsive.\nFor both SPV and PPV the patient must be mechanically ventilated and in a\nregular rhythm (not in atrial fibrillation) for the calculations. Measurements of\nBP are with an arterial line. This patient has been extubated, so measurement\nof PPV or SPV cannot be performed.

    ],
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "Color Flow . This Doppler modality is an application of pulsed wave\nDoppler technology that allows determination of velocity at a specific location.\nVelocity is color coded and superimposed over a two-dimensional image.\nHowever, like pulsed wave Doppler, color Doppler is limited by signal aliasing.\nFluid or tissue that moves toward the probe causes compression of sound\nwaves and an increase in the received frequency, whereas motion away from\nthe probe leads to a reduced frequency. Although ultrasound machine color\nmaps can often be adjusted, by convention flow toward the probe is coded red,\nwhereas flow away from the probe is coded blue (BART: Blue Away Red\nToward).\nContinuous wave Doppler . Continuous wave Doppler uses two dedicated\nultrasound crystals, one for continuous transmission and a second for\ncontinuous reception of ultrasound signals. This permits measurement of very\nhigh frequency Doppler shifts or velocities. The “cost” is range ambiguity. In\nother words, the precise location of the peak velocity along the length of the\nDoppler cursor is not definitely known. Instead, the clinician must infer the\nlocation of the highest velocity, such as a stenotic aortic valve. Continuous\nwave Doppler is used for measuring very high velocities (e.g., stenosis of a\nvalve or prosthesis).\nPulsed Doppler . In contrast to continuous wave Doppler, which records the\nsignal along the entire length of the ultrasound beam, pulsed wave Doppler\npermits sampling of blood flow velocities from a specific region, known as the\nsample volume. This modality is particularly useful for assessing the relatively\nlow velocity flows associated with transmitral or transtricuspid blood flow,\npulmonary venous flow, and left atrial appendage flow. To permit this, a pulse\nof ultrasound is transmitted by a single piezoelectric crystal, and then the\nreceiver “listens” during a subsequent interval defined by the distance from the\ntransmitter and the sample site. This transducer mode of transmit-wait-receive\nis repeated at an interval termed the pulse-repetition frequency (PRF). The\nPRF is therefore depth dependent, being greater for near regions and lower for\ndistant or deeper regions. The position of the sample volume is varied by\nadjusting the length of the transducer “receive” interval. In contrast to\ncontinuous wave Doppler, which is sometimes performed without twodimensional\nguidance, pulsed Doppler is always performed with twodimensional\nguidance to determine the sample volume position. Because\npulsed wave Doppler echo repeatedly samples the returning signal, there is a\nmaximum limit to the frequency shift or velocity that can be measured\nunambiguously. Thus the maximum detectable frequency shift, or Nyquist\nlimit, is one half the PRF. If the velocity of interest exceeds the Nyquist limit,\n“wraparound” of the signal occurs, first into the reverse channel and then back\nto the forward channel; this is known as aliasing.

      "Negative-pressure leak test",
      "Common gas outlet occlusion test",
      "Traditional positive-pressure leak test",
      "None of the above"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "explanation": "Anesthesia machines should be checked each day before their use. For most\nmachines, three parts are checked before use: calibration for the oxygen\nanalyzer, the low-pressure circuit leak test, and the circle system. Many\nconsider the low-pressure circuit the area most vulnerable for problems\nbecause it is more subject to leaks. Leaks in this part of the machine have been\nassociated with intraoperative awareness (e.g., loose vaporizer filling caps) and\nhypoxia. To test the low-pressure part of the machine, several tests have been\nused. For the positive-pressure test, positive pressure is applied to the circuit by\ndepressing the oxygen flush button and occluding the Y-piece of the circle\nsystem (which is connected to the endotracheal tube or the anesthesia mask\nduring anesthetic administration) and looking for positive pressure detected by\nthe airway pressure gauge. A leak in the low-pressure part of the machine or\nthe circle system will be demonstrated by a decrease in airway pressure. With\nmany newer machines, a check valve is positioned downstream from the\nflowmeters (rotameters) and vaporizers but upstream from the oxygen flush\nvalve, which would not permit the positive pressure from the circle system to\nflow back to the low-pressure circuit. In these machines with the check valve,\nthe positive-pressure reading will fall only with a leak in the circle part, but a\nleak in the low-pressure circuit of the anesthesia machine will not be detected.\nIn 1993 use of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration universal negativepressure\nleak test was encouraged, whereby the machine master switch and the\nflow valves are turned off, and a suction bulb is collapsed and attached to the\ncommon or fresh gas outlet of the machine. If the bulb stays fully collapsed for\nat least 10 seconds, a leak did not exist (this needs to be repeated for each\nvaporizer, each one opened at a time). Of course, when the test is completed,\nthe fresh gas hose is reconnected to the circle system. Because machines\ncontinue to be developed and to differ from one another, you should be familiar\nwith each manufacturer’s machine preoperative checklist. For example, the\nnegative-pressure leak test is recommended for Ohmeda Unitrol, Ohmeda\n30/70, Ohmeda Modulus I, Ohmeda Modulus II and II plus, Ohmeda Excel\nseries, Ohmeda CD, and Datex-Ohmeda Aestiva. The Drنger Narkomed 2A,\n2B, 2C, 3, 4, and GS require a positive-pressure leak test. The Fabius GS,\nNarkomed 6000, and Datex-Ohmeda S5/ADU have self-tests (Miller: Miller’ s\nAnesthesia, ed 8, pp 752–755; Barash: Clinical Anesthesia, ed 8, p 654).\n(Reprinted with permission from Andrews JJ: Understanding anesthesia machines.

      "Pressure-sensor shutoff valve",
      "Adjustable pressure-limiting valve"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "Check valves permit only unidirectional flow of gases. These valves prevent\nretrograde flow of gases from the anesthesia machine or the transfer of gas\nfrom a compressed-gas cylinder at high pressure into a container at a lower\npressure. Thus these unidirectional valves will allow an empty compressed-gas\ncylinder to be exchanged for a full one during operation of the anesthesia\nmachine with minimal loss of gas. The adjustable pressure-limiting valve is a\nsynonym for a pop-off valve and can be adjusted to allow varying degrees of\npressure to be transmitted to the patient. A fail-safe valve is a synonym for a\npressure-sensor shutoff valve. The purpose of a fail-safe valve is to discontinue\nthe flow of N2 O (or proportionally reduce it) if the O2 pressure within the\nanesthesia machine falls below 30 psi (Miller: Miller’s Anesthesia, ed 8, p 756;\nBarash: Clinical Anesthesia, ed 8, p 657)."

A compressed-gas cylinder completely filled\nwith O2 has a pressure of approximately 2000 psi and contains approximately\n625 L of gas. According to Boyle’s law, the volume of gas remaining in a\nclosed container can be estimated by measuring the pressure within the\ncontainer. Therefore, when the pressure gauge on a compressed-gas cylinder\ncontaining O2 shows a pressure of 1600 psi, the cylinder contains 500 L (1600\npsi /2100 psi = 0.77 and 0.77 times 650 = 500) of O2 .

The purpose\nof the fail-safe valve is to prevent the delivery of hypoxic gas mixtures from\nthe anesthesia machine to the patient resulting from failure of the O2 supply.\nMost modern anesthesia machines, however, would not allow a hypoxic\nmixture, because the knob controlling the N2 O is linked to the O2 knob.\nWhen the O2 pressure within the anesthesia machine decreases below 30 psi,\nthis valve discontinues the flow of N2 O or proportionally decreases the flow\nof all gases. It is important to realize that this valve will not prevent the\ndelivery of hypoxic gas mixtures or pure N2 O when the O2 rotameter is off,\nbecause the O2 pressure within the circuits of the anesthesia machine is\nmaintained by an open O2 compressed-gas cylinder or a central supply source.\nUnder these circumstances, an O2 analyzer will be needed to detect the\ndelivery of a hypoxic gas mixture (Ehrenwerth: Anesthesia Equipment:\nPrinciples and Applications, ed 2, pp 37 –40; Barash: Clinical Anesthesia, ed\n8, p 656)."

    "explanation": "The standard method for BP measurements introduced by NS Korotkoff in\n1905 was by auscultation, which measures the systolic (first sounds heard\nwhen the BP cuff is deflated) and diastolic BP (significantly muffled or\ndisappearance of sounds with further deflation of the cuff), but not the mean\narterial blood pressure (MAP). MAP is calculated using the following formula:\nThe reason the diastolic BP is multiplied by 2 is that the diastolic portion of\nthe cardiac cycle is usually twice as long as the systolic portion of the cardiac\ncycle.\nANIBP measurements are based on oscillometry, with small changes in cuff\npressure during cuff deflation used to estimate mean arterial BP. Both systolic\nand diastolic pressures are calculated according to proprietary algorithms by\neach manufacturer and are therefore less reliable than the values for MAP.\nTypically systolic BP corresponds to a pressure where escalating pulsations\nreach 25% to 50% of maximum. Diastolic pressure is the most unreliable\ncalculation and is derived when the pulse amplitude is a small fraction of the\npeak amplitude. (Miller: Anesthesia, ed 8, pp 1347 –1348)."

Measured-flow vaporizers (nonconcentration calibrated vaporizers)\ninclude the obsolete Copper Kettle and Vernitrol vaporizers. With measuredflow\nvaporizers, the flow of oxygen is selected on a separate flowmeter to pass\ninto the vaporizing chamber, from which the anesthetic vapor emerges at its\nsaturated vapor pressure. By contrast, in variable-bypass vaporizers, the total\ngas flow is split between a variable bypass and the vaporizer chamber\ncontaining the anesthetic agent. The ratio of these two flows is called the\nsplitting ratio.

    "explanation": "Most anesthesia machines have a circle absorption system, which includes\na canister of carbon dioxide (CO2 ) absorbent that can effectively absorb\nexhaled CO2 . This allows the anesthesia machines to use lower fresh gas\nflows, decreasing the amount of expensive inhaled anesthetics used. CO2\nabsorbents use the principle of neutralizing an acid (CO2 + H2 O produces\ncarbonic acid = H2 CO3 ) with a base (mostly calcium hydroxide = Ca(OH)2 ).\nSome natural hydration of the granules is essential to allow the chemical\nreactions to occur. The end product of the reaction is calcium carbonate, water,\nand heat.\nH2 CO3 + Ca(OH)2 produces calcium carbonate (CaCO3 ) + H2 O + Heat\nSoda Lime contains: 76% to 81% Ca(OH)2 , 14% to 19% H2 O, 4% NaOH,\nand 1% KOH. NaOH and KOH serve as an effective catalyst for the chemical\nreactions to occur. Unfortunately, these catalysts degrade sevoflurane to the\nnephrotoxic called compound A, and degrade desflurane as well as isoflurane\nto produce clinically significant amounts of carbon monoxide (CO) when the\ngranules are desiccated.\nThe catalyst used in Amsorb Plus and Litholyme does not degrade sevoflurane\nto compound A and does not produce CO from volatile anesthetics when the\ngranules are desiccated.\nAmsorb Plus contains; > 80% Ca(OH)2 , 13% to 18% H2 O, and 4% CaCl2\nLitholyme contains; > 75% Ca(OH)2 , 12% to 19% H2 O, and 3% LiCl\nThe indicator dye used in soda lime that changes from off-white to violet can\nchange back to the original white color when the granules dry. In contrast, the\nindicator dye for Amsorb Plus and Litholyme changes from off-white to violet\nbut does not change back to off-white.\nThe absorptive capacity of Litholyme is similar to soda lime and slightly better\nthan Amsorb Plus. In addition, there is less heat produced with the chemical\nreaction with Amsorb Plus and Litholyme compared with soda lime.\nChanneling can occur with any absorbent type, and frank fire has only been\nreported with Baralyme, which is no longer available (Miller: Basics of\nAnesthesia, ed 7, pp 233 –236; Miller: Miller’s Anesthesia, ed 8, pp 660 –663,\n787)."

    "explanation": "Recommendations for Pre-Anesthesia Checkout (PAC) Procedures (2008)\nmade by the subcommittee of the American Society of Anesthesiologists\n(ASA) Committee on Equipment and Facilities clearly state, “the anesthesia\ncare provider is ultimately responsible for proper function of all equipment\nused to provide anesthesia care.”\nMost anesthesia delivery systems have two sources of oxygen, a pipeline\nsupply of oxygen (with a pressure > 50 psi) and a backup oxygen cylinder in\ncase there is a problem with the anesthesia pipeline supply. Item #5 of the\nASA PAC refers to an adequate amount of pressure on the spare oxygen\ncylinder mounted on the anesthesia machine. Because of the increasing\ncomplexity of anesthesia delivery systems, the operating manuals should be\nunderstood. In general, the oxygen cylinder is used only when there is a failure\nof the pipeline oxygen supply. If there is no pipeline supply, then the oxygen\ncylinder must supply oxygen for the entire anesthetic. Although the ASA’s\n2008 checkout guidelines do not specify an exact pressure, manufacturer’s\nmanuals often recommend an oxygen cylinder pressure of > 1000 psi.\nAfter the tank is checked and found to have an adequate oxygen pressure, the\ntank’s valve should be closed. The reason for closing the valve is to allow the\nactivation of the machine’s oxygen pressure alert when the pipeline pressure\ndrops below a specific pressure. If activated, the provider becomes aware of the\nfailure in pipeline supply of oxygen and then opens the valve to use the oxygen\ncylinder, knowing that the backup oxygen source is now being used. If the\nvalve is left open and the pipeline supply fails, then the oxygen pressure alert\nwill become activated only when the oxygen tank is also empty (American\nSociety of Anesthesiology – Recommendations for Pre Anesthesia Checkout\nProcedures (2008) in asahq.org ; Miller: Miller’s Anesthesia, ed 8, pp 804 –\n817)."

Because the frequency filters\ncan distort the ECG and produce false positive recordings (e.g., the ST\nsegment or T wave changes), manufacturers have several filter modes,\nincluding a diagnostic mode that removes the filters. So if the ECG monitor\nlooks different from the preoperative ECG, it may be best to turn off the filters\nand use the diagnostic mode (Miller: Basics of Anesthesia, 7th ed, pp 345 –\n346; Miller: Miller’s Anesthesia, ed 8, pp 1434 –2435)."

    "explanation": "CO can be generated when volatile anesthetics are exposed to CO2\nabsorbers that contain NaOH or KOH (e.g., soda lime) and have sometimes\nproduced carboxyhemoglobin levels of 35%. Factors that are involved in the\nproduction of CO and formation of carboxyhemoglobin include (1) the specific\nvolatile anesthetic used (desflurane ≥ enflurane > isoflurane ≫ sevoflurane =\nhalothane), (2) high concentrations of volatile anesthetic (more CO is\ngenerated at higher volatile concentrations), (3) high temperatures (more CO is\ngenerated at higher temperatures), (4) low fresh gas flows, and especially (5)\ndry soda lime (dry granules produce more CO than do hydrated granules).\nSoda lime contains 15% water by weight, and only when it gets dehydrated to\nbelow 1.4% will appreciable amounts of CO be formed. Many of the reported\ncases of patients experiencing elevated carboxyhemoglobin levels occurred on\nMonday mornings, when the fresh gas flow on the anesthesia circuit was not\nturned off and high anesthetic fresh gas flows (> 5 L/min) for prolonged\nperiods of time (e.g., > 48 hours) occurred. Because of some resistance of the\ninspiratory valve, retrograde flow through the CO2 absorber (which hastens the\ndrying of the soda lime) will develop, especially if the breathing bag is absent,\nthe Y-piece of the circuit is occluded, and the adjustable pressure-limiting\nvalve is open. Whenever you are uncertain as to the dryness of the CO2\nabsorber, especially when the fresh gas flow was not turned off the anesthesia\nmachine for an extended or indeterminate period of time, the CO2 absorber\nshould be changed. This CO production occurs with soda lime and occurred\nmore so with Baralyme (which is no longer available), but it does not occur\nwith Amsorb Plus or Drنgersorb Free (which contains calcium chloride and\ncalcium hydroxide and no NaOH or KOH) (Miller: Miller’s Anesthesia, ed 8,\npp 789 –792; Barash: Clinical Anesthesia, ed 8, pp 681 –683)."

The\nfour phases of the capnogram are inspiratory baseline, expiratory upstroke,\nexpiratory plateau, and inspiratory downstroke. The shape of the capnogram\ncan be used to recognize and diagnose a variety of potentially adverse\ncircumstances. Under normal conditions, the inspiratory baseline should be 0,\nindicating that there is no rebreathing of CO2 with a normal functioning circle\nbreathing system. If the inspiratory baseline is elevated above 0, there is\nrebreathing of CO2 .\nIf this occurs, the differential diagnosis should include an incompetent\nexpiratory valve, exhausted CO2 absorbent, or gas channeling through the CO2\nabsorbent. However, the inspiratory baseline may be elevated when the\ninspiratory valve is incompetent (e.g., there may be a slanted inspiratory\ndownstroke). The expiratory upstroke occurs when the fresh gas from the\nanatomic dead space is quickly replaced by CO2 -rich alveolar gas. Under\nnormal conditions, the upstroke should be steep; however, it may become\nslanted during partial airway obstruction, if a sidestream analyzer is sampling\ngas too slowly, or if the response time of the capnograph is too slow for the\npatient’s respiratory rate. Partial obstruction may be the result of an\nobstruction in the breathing system (e.g., by a kinked endotracheal tube) or in\nthe patient’s airway (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD] or\nacute bronchospasm). The expiratory plateau is normally characterized by a\nslow but shallow progressive increase in CO2 concentration. This occurs\nbecause of imperfect matching of ventilation and perfusion in all lung units.\nPartial obstruction of gas flow either in the breathing system or in the patient’s\nairways may cause a prolonged increase in the slope of the expiratory plateau,\nwhich may continue rising until the next inspiratory downstroke begins. The\ninspiratory downstroke is caused by the rapid influx of fresh gas, which washes\nthe CO2 away from the CO2 sensing or sampling site. Under normal\nconditions, the inspiratory downstroke is very steep. The causes of a slanted or\nblunted inspiratory downstroke include an incompetent inspiratory valve, slow\nmechanical inspiration, slow gas sampling, and partial CO2 rebreathing\n(Ehrenwerth: Anesthesia Equipment: Principles and Applications, ed 2, p 248;\nBarash: Clinical Anesthesia, ed 8, pp 711 –712; Miller: Basics of Anesthesia,\ned 7, 342 –347)."

    "explanation": "Lithotripsy is a noninvasive treatment using ultrasonic shock waves to\nbreak apart kidney stones. There are three main components of lithotripters; an\nenergy source, a system to focus the shock wave, and fluoroscopy or\nultrasound to visualize and localize the stone in focus. Because most\nlithotripters are triggered by the R wave of the ECG and can be fired\ninappropriately by the atrial-pacing artifact (with the potential of producing\nserious cardiac dysrhythmias), pacemakers should be changed to a mode that\ndoes not pace the atrium. Thus the lithotripter has no possibility of\nmisinterpreting the atrial spike as an R wave. In addition, the shock waves can\ninterfere with pacemaker function, and some devices can be damaged, so an\nalternative means of pacing should be available. After the lithotripter\nprocedure, the pacemaker should be reactivated to the patient’s original mode\n(in this case DDD) and checked for proper functioning. If the patient has an\nautomatic implanted cardioverter-defibrillator (AICD), the AICD needs to be\nturned off during the treatment and reactivated after the treatment.

    "explanation": "Pulse oximeters estimate arterial hemoglobin saturation (Sao 2 ) by\nmeasuring the amount of light transmitted through a pulsatile vascular tissue\nbed. Pulse oximeters measure the alternating current component of light\nabsorbance at each of two wavelengths (660 and 940 nm) and then divide this\nmeasurement by the corresponding direct current component. Then the ratio\n(R) of the two absorbance measurements is determined by the following\nequation:\nUsing an empiric calibration curve that relates arterial hemoglobin saturation\nto R, the actual arterial hemoglobin saturation is calculated. Based on the\nphysical principles outlined above, the sources of error in Spo 2 readings can be\neasily predicted. Pulse oximeters can function accurately when only two\nhemoglobin species, oxyhemoglobin and reduced hemoglobin, are present. If\nany light-absorbing species other than oxyhemoglobin and reduced\nhemoglobin are present, the pulse oximeter measurements will be inaccurate.\nFetal hemoglobin has a minimal effect on the accuracy of pulse oximetry\nbecause the extinction coefficients for fetal hemoglobin at the two wavelengths\nused by pulse oximetry are very similar to the corresponding values for adult\nhemoglobin. In addition to abnormal hemoglobins, any substance present in\nthe blood that absorbs light at either 660 or 940 nm, such as intravenous dyes\nused for diagnostic purposes, will affect the value of R, making accurate\nmeasurements of the pulse oximeter impossible. These dyes include methylene\nblue and indigo carmine. Methylene blue has the greatest effect on Sao 2\nmeasurements because the extinction coefficient is so similar to that of\noxyhemoglobin.

    "explanation": "Gas density decreases with increasing altitude (i.e., the density of a gas is\ndirectly proportional to atmospheric pressure). Atmospheric pressure will\ninfluence the function of rotameters because the accurate function of\nrotameters is influenced by the physical properties of the gas, such as density\nand viscosity. The magnitude of this influence, however, depends on the rate of\ngas flow. At low gas flows, the pattern of gas flow is laminar. Atmospheric\npressure will have little effect on the accurate function of rotameters at low gas\nflows because laminar gas flow is influenced by gas viscosity (which is\nminimally affected by atmospheric pressure), not by gas density. However, at\nhigh gas flows, the gas flow pattern is turbulent and is influenced by gas\ndensity.

    "explanation": "Laser refers to Light Amplification by the Stimulated Emission of\nRadiation. Laser light differs from ordinary light in three main ways. First,\nlaser light is monochromic (possesses one wavelength or color). Second, laser\nlight is coherent (the photons oscillate in the same phase). Third, laser light is\ncollimated (exists in a narrow parallel beam). Visible light has a wide\nspectrum of wavelengths in the 385- to 760-nm range. Argon laser light, which\ncan penetrate tissues to a depth of 0.05 to 2.0 mm, is either blue (wavelength\n488 nm) or green (wavelength 514 nm) and is often used for vascular\npigmented lesions because it is intensively absorbed by hemoglobin. Helium–\nneon laser light is red, has a frequency of 632 nm, and is often used as an\naiming beam because it has very low power and presents no significant danger\nto OR personnel. Nd:YAG laser light is the most powerful medical laser and\ncan penetrate tissues from 2 to 6 mm. Nd:YAG laser light is in the near\ninfrared range, with a wavelength of 1064 nm, has general uses (e.g., prostate\nsurgery, laryngeal papillomatosis, coagulation), and can be used with\nfiberoptics. CO2 laser light is in the far infrared range, with a long wavelength\nof 10,600 nm.

    "explanation": "There are four methods of administering anesthetic gases to a patient;\nmask, supraglottic airway, endotracheal tube, and a surgical airway\n(tracheostomy). The first supraglottic airway (laryngeal mask airway or LMA)\nwas used in 1988. The LMA is basically an airway tube with a distal elliptical\ninflatable mask that has an anterior aperture. The LMA is inserted blindly into\nthe pharynx, and the mask is inflated to obtain a seal around the glottis\nopening. The original LMA had two small, narrow bar-like structures to cover\nthe distal opening. Because of the bar-like structures, you cannot pass an\nendotracheal tube through the airway tube of the LMA. The LMA Fastrach\n(Intubating LMA or ILMA) does not have the bar-like structures so that an\nendotracheal tube can be passed through the LMA into the trachea; then the\nLMA could be removed, leaving the endotracheal tube in the trachea. One\ndisadvantage of the original LMA is the inability to empty the stomach. The\nreusable LMA Proseal and the single-use LMA Supreme were designed with\nthe mask modified to extend the posterior surface for an improved seal, a builtin\nbite block to decrease the chance of an obstructed airway lumen, and a\nsecond lumen that allows for a suction catheter to pass through the LMA into\nthe stomach. The Air-Q is another second-generation supraglottic airway, with\na shorter airway tube, a bite block, and a removable circuit connector that\nmore easily allows one to pass a standard endotracheal tube through the LMA\ninto the trachea. The I-Gel is another second-generation supraglottic airway\nthat was designed as a noninflatable supraglottic airway with a soft, gel-like\nseal. The I-Gel has a gastric channel that runs from the distal tip to an outlet\nlateral to the airway connector and allows for the insertion of a gastric tube.\nSuctioning of the stomach is not possible with the LMA Fastrach or Air- Q\nsupraglottic airways.

    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "Electrocautery units, or electrosurgical units (ESUs), were invented by\nProfessor W. T. Bovie and were first used in 1926. They operate by generating\nultra-high frequency (0.1-3 MHz) alternating electric currents and are\ncommonly used today for cutting and coagulating tissue. Whenever a current\npasses through a resistance such as tissue, heat is generated and is inversely\nproportional to the surface area through which the current passes. At the point\nof entry to the body from the small active electrode or cautery tip, a fair\namount of heat is generated. For the current to complete its circuit, the return\nelectrode plate or dispersive pad (incorrectly but commonly called the ground\npad) has a large surface area, where very little heat develops. The dispersive\npad should be as close as is reasonable to the site of surgery. If the current\nfrom the ESU passes through an artificial cardiac pacemaker, the pacemaker\nmay misinterpret the current as cardiac activity and may not pace, which is\nwhy a magnet placed over the pacemaker will turn off the pacemaker sensor,\nputting the pacemaker in the asynchronous mode, and should be available (if\nthe pacemaker’s sensory mode is not turned off preoperatively). In addition,\nautomatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (AICDs) may misinterpret the\nelectric activity as ventricular fibrillation and defibrillate the patient. AICDs\nshould be turned off before use of an ESU. (Barash: Clinical Anesthesia, ed 8,\npp 125 –127)."

    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "ANIBP devices provide consistent and reliable arterial BP measurements.\nVariations in the cuff pressure resulting from arterial pulsations during cuff\ndeflation are sensed by the device and are used to calculate MAP. Then, values\nfor systolic and diastolic pressures are derived from formulas that use the rate\nof change of the arterial pressure pulsations and the MAP (oscillometric\nprinciple). This method provides accurate measurements of arterial BP in\nneonates, infants, children, and adults. The main advantage of ANIBP devices\nis that they free the anesthesia provider to perform other duties required for\noptimal anesthesia care. Additionally, these devices provide alarm systems to\ndraw attention to extreme BP values, and they have the capacity to transfer\ndata to automated trending devices or recorders. Improper use of these devices\ncan lead to erroneous measurements and complications. The width of the BP\ncuff should be approximately 40% of the circumference of the patient’s arm. If\nthe BP cuff is too narrow or if the BP cuff is wrapped too loosely around the\narm, the BP measurement by the device will be falsely elevated. Frequent BP\nmeasurements can result in edema of the extremity distal to the cuff. For this\nreason, cycling of these devices should not be more frequent than every 1 to 3\nminutes. Other complications associated with improper use of ANIBP devices\ninclude ulnar nerve paresthesia, superficial thrombophlebitis, and\ncompartment syndrome. Fortunately, these complications are rare.

    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "explanation": "The esophageal detector device (EDD) is essentially a bulb that is first\ncompressed and then attached to the endotracheal tube after the tube is\ninserted into the patient. The pressure generated is about −40 cm of water. If\nthe endotracheal tube is placed in the esophagus, then the negative pressure\nwill collapse the esophagus, and the bulb will not inflate. If the endotracheal\ntube is in the trachea, then the air from the lung will enable the bulb to inflate\n(usually in a few seconds, but sometimes more than 30 seconds).

Although initial\nstudies were very positive about the use of the EDD, more recent studies show\nthat up to 30% of correctly placed endotracheal tubes in adults may be\nremoved because the EDD has suggested esophageal placement. Misleading\nresults have been noted in patients with morbid obesity, late pregnancy, status\nasthmaticus, and copious endotracheal secretion, wherein the trachea tends to\ncollapse.

    "explanation": "The capnometer measures the CO2 concentration of respiratory gases.\nToday this is most commonly performed by infrared absorption using a\nsidestream gas sample. The sampling tube should be connected as close as\npossible to the patient’s airway. The difference between the end-tidal CO2 (Etco\n2 ) and the arterial CO2 (Paco 2 ) is typically 5 to 10 mm Hg and is due to\nalveolar dead space ventilation. Because nonperfused alveoli do not contribute\nto gas exchange, any condition that increases alveolar dead space ventilation\n(i.e., reduces pulmonary blood flow, as by pulmonary embolism or cardiac\narrest) will increase dead space ventilation and the Etco 2 -to-Paco 2 difference.\nConditions that increase pulmonary shunt result in minimal changes in the\nPaco 2 –Etco 2 gradient.

This\nmeans that the gas that flows through the vaporizers is split into two parts,\ndepending on the concentration selected. The gas goes through either the\nbypass chamber on the top of the vaporizer or the vaporizing chamber on the\nbottom of the vaporizer. If the vaporizer is tipped, which might happen when a\nfilled vaporizer is switched out or moved from one machine to another\nmachine, part of the anesthetic liquid in the vaporizing chamber may get into\nthe bypass chamber. This could result in a much higher concentration of gas\nthan that dialed. With the Datex-Ohmeda Tec 4 or the North American Drنger\nVapor 19.1 series, it is recommended to flush the vaporizer at high flows with\nthe vaporizer set at a low concentration until the output shows no excessive\nagent (this usually takes 20-30 minutes). The Drنger Vapor 2000 series has a\ntransport (T) dial setting. This setting isolates the bypass from the vaporizer\nchamber.

    "explanation": "Accurate delivery of volatile anesthetic concentration is dependent on\nfilling the agent-specific vaporizer with the appropriate (volatile) agent.\nDifferences in anesthetic potencies further necessitate this requirement. Each\nagent-specific vaporizer uses a splitting ratio that determines the portion of the\nfresh gas that is directed through the vaporizing chamber versus that which\ntravels through the bypass chamber.\nBP, blood pressure; VP, vapor pressure.\nVapor pressure, anesthetic vapor pressure, and\nsplitting ratio\nThe table shows the calculation (fraction) that when multiplied by the quantity of\nfresh gas traversing the vaporizing chamber (affluent fresh gas in mL/min) will yield\nthe output (mL/min) of anesthetic vapor in the effluent gas. When this fraction is\nmultiplied by 100, it equals the splitting ratio for 1% for the given volatile agent. For\nexample, when the isoflurane vaporizer is set to deliver 1% isoflurane, one part of fresh\ngas is passed through the vaporizing chamber while 47 parts travel through the bypass\nchamber. One can determine on inspection that when a less soluble volatile agent like\nsevoflurane (or the obsolete volatile agent enflurane, for the sake of example) is placed\ninto an isoflurane (or halothane) vaporizer, the output in volume percent will be less\nthan expected; how much less can be determined by simply comparing their splitting\nratios 27/47 or 0.6. Halothane and enflurane are no longer used in the United States,\nbut old halothane and enflurane vaporizers can be (and are) used elsewhere in the\nworld to accurately deliver isoflurane and sevoflurane, respectively (Ehrenwerth:\nAnesthesia Equipment: Principles and Applications, ed 2, pp 72 –73; Miller: Miller’s\nAnesthesia, ed 8, pp 771 –774)."

Changing the I:E ratio\nfrom 1:3 to 1:2 will permit 8% (25% inspiratory time to 33% inspiratory time)\nmore time for the VT to be administered and will result in lower airway\npressures. Decreasing the VT to 300 and increasing the rate to 28 would give\nthe same minute ventilation but not the same alveolar ventilation. Recall that\nalveolar ventilation equals (frequency) times (VT minus dead space), and\nbecause dead space is the same (about 2 mL/kg ideal weight), alveolar\nventilation would be reduced, in this case to a dangerously low level.

    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "Within the respiratory system, both laminar and turbulent flows exist. At\nlow flow rates, the respiratory flow tends to be laminar, like a series of\nconcentric tubes that slide over one another with the center tubes flowing\nfaster than the more peripheral tubes. Laminar flow is usually inaudible and is\ndependent on gas viscosity. Turbulent flow tends to be faster, is audible, and is\ndependent on gas density. Gas density can be decreased by using a mixture of\nhelium with oxygen. (Barash: Clinical Anesthesia, ed 8, pp 365 –366)."

    "explanation": "Anesthesia workstations have high-pressure, intermediate-pressure, and\nlow-pressure circuits (see figure in the explanation for Question 11). The highpressure\ncircuit is from the oxygen cylinder to the oxygen pressure regulator\n(first-stage regulator), which takes the oxygen pressure from a high of 2200 psi\nto 45 psi. The intermediate-pressure circuit consists of the pipeline pressure of\nabout 50 to 55 psi and goes to the second-stage regulator, which then lowers\nthe pressure to 14 to 26 psi (depending on the machine). The low-pressure\ncircuit then consists of the flow tubes, vaporizer manifold, vaporizers, and\nvaporizer check valve to the common gas outlet. The oxygen flush valve is in\nthe intermediate-pressure circuit and bypasses the low-pressure circuit\n(Ehrenwerth: Anesthesia Equipment: Principles and Applications, ed 2, pp 34\n–36; Miller: Miller’s Anesthesia, ed 8, p 759; Barash: Clinical Anesthesia, ed\n8, pp 652, 667 –668)."

The first obvious\nproblem is the inspired oxygen concentration of 4%, a concentration that is not\npossible if the gases going to the machine are appropriate unless the oxygen\nanalyzer is faulty. Given the dire consequences of a hypoxic gas mixture, one\nmust assume the oxygen analyzer is correct and work on the premise that the\nO2 pipeline is supplying a gas other than oxygen. Second, the oxygen line\npressure is 65 psi. The pipeline pressures are normally around 50 to 55 psi,\nwhereas the pressure from the oxygen cylinder, if the cylinder is turned on, is\nreduced to 45 psi. For the oxygen tank to deliver oxygen to the patient, the\npipeline pressure needs to be less than 45 psi, which in this case will occur\nonly when the pipeline is disconnected. Although we rarely think of problems\nwith hospital gas lines, a survey of more than 200 hospitals showed about 33%\nhad problems with the pipelines.

    "explanation": "Calcium hydroxide lime does not contain the monovalent hydroxide bases\nthat are present in soda lime (namely, NaOH and KOH). Sevoflurane in the\npresence of NaOH or KOH is degraded to trace amounts of compound A,\nwhich is nephrotoxic to rats at high concentrations. Soda lime normally\ncontains about 13% to 15% water, but if the soda lime is desiccated (water\ncontent < 5%—which has occurred if the machine is not used for a while and\nthe fresh gas flow is left on) and is exposed to current volatile anesthetics\n(isoflurane, sevoflurane, and especially desflurane), CO can be produced.\nNeither compound A nor CO is formed when calcium hydroxide lime is used.\nWith soda lime and calcium hydroxide lime, the indicator dye changes from\nwhite to purple as the granules become exhausted. The two major\ndisadvantages of calcium hydroxide lime are the expense and the fact that its\nabsorptive capacity is about half that of soda lime (10.2 L of CO2 /100 g of\ncalcium hydroxide lime versus 26 L of CO2 /100 g of soda lime).

Palliative care is not limited\nto patients who are expected to die within 6 months. Goals are directed to help\nwith the patient’s pain, anxiety, and depression, as well as to provide family\nsupport. Inpatient palliative care teams have been shown to decrease inpatient\nhospital costs for patients who are discharged from the hospital, as well as for\npatients who have died in the hospital. In addition, there were fewer deaths in\nthe ICU after palliative care programs were started. Initially, these care teams\nfocused on medical ICUs, but now include surgical ICUs as well as outpatient\nclinics. Palliative care is appropriate at any stage of a serious illness and can be\nused in conjunction with “aggressive” care. Hospice care has several\nsimilarities to palliative care but usually refers to care for patients on homebased\ncare with a life expectancy < 6 months. In the United States 80% of the\nfees for hospice care are paid by Medicare.

An acute\nincrease in Paco 2 of 10 mm Hg will result in a decrease in pH of\napproximately 0.08 pH unit. The acidosis of arterial blood will stimulate\nventilation via the carotid bodies, and the acidosis of cerebrospinal fluid will\nstimulate ventilation via the medullary chemoreceptors located in the fourth\ncerebral ventricle.

    "explanation": "With a total laryngectomy (TL), a tracheostomy is performed and a wirereinforced\nendotracheal tube (ETT) is placed into the trachea early in the\nprocedure. The thyroid gland is usually preserved after dividing the thyroid\nisthmus, and the entire larynx is then resected, with the pharyngeal connection\nto the airway completely closed, making the trachea completely independent\nfrom the oropharynx. The opening of the trachea is sutured to the anterior skin\nof the neck, producing a stoma, and often there is no need to keep the ETT\nplaced in the tracheostomy site intraoperatively for postoperative ventilation.\nHowever, in cases where there is edema at the stomal site or a free flap is\nneeded, an ETT can remain in place or be replaced with a tracheostomy tube\nfor a period of time postoperatively to maintain an adequate opening to the\nairway.

A P50 greater than 26 mm Hg describes a rightward\nshift of the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve. This means that at any given\nPao 2 , hemoglobin has a lower affinity for O2 .

    "explanation": "Adult respiratory distress disorder (ARDS) was first reported in adults in\n1967 and is associated with decreased lung compliance. Initial therapies for\nARDS included mechanical ventilation with tidal volumes of 10 to 15 mL/kg,\nwith rates to achieve a normal pH and Paco 2 . In 2000 the National Institutes\nof Health (NIH) ARDS Network (ARDSNet) trial noted a reduction in\nmortality for patients with ARDS who were ventilated with low tidal volumes\n(6 mL/kg predicted body weight [PBW]—mortality rate of 31%) compared\nwith traditional tidal volumes (12 mL/kg PBW—mortality rate of 40%). It was\nfelt that the larger tidal volumes caused overdistention of the alveoli (i.e.,\nproduced volume trauma or volutrauma). This increased alveolar volume\nresulted in mechanical injury and a systemic inflammatory response. It was felt\nthat the stretch and not the pressure (barotrauma) caused the release of the\ninflammatory cytokinins into the circulation. Because the lower tidal volumes\nused were associated with an elevation of arterial CO2 and lower arterial\noxygen levels, the term “permissive hypercapnia and hypoxemia” was used.\nPatients with ARDS also develop atelectasis. Recruitment maneuvers\n(sustained breaths of increased airway pressures) were used to re-expand\natelectatic alveoli to avoid atelectrauma. However, results with the recruitment\nbreaths showed only a transient increase in oxygenation and no change in\nmortality. Another respiratory technique proposed included the use of inhaled\nnitric oxide (iNO) that can improve ventilation-perfusion mismatch and\nimprove oxygenation. Randomized controlled studies have shown only limited\neffectiveness, with no overall improvement in mortality or duration of\nventilation. Further studies are looking at iNO for specific conditions (e.g.,\nsevere pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular failure, refractory\nhypoxemia) (Miller: Miller’s Anesthesia, ed 8, pp 3040–3044, 3078–3079;\nBarash: Clinical Anesthesia, ed 8, pp 1644–1645) ."

    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "explanation": "Three main risk factors for death from burns include inhalation injury,\nburn size (> 40%), and age (> 60 years). Patients who have sustained major\nburns from a fire can rapidly deteriorate. Areas of concern include airway\nmanagement, carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning, pain, edema, fluid\nmanagement, intravenous access, maintenance of body temperature and\nprevention of infections.\nAirway and lung injury can result from direct tissue injury as well as\ninflammatory mediators from burned tissues, infection, and fluid resuscitation.\nSigns of impending airway difficulty include stridor, voice changes, and\ncoughing up carbonaceous material. Explosive injuries involving the head and\nupper torso are at high risk for airway difficulty. Because upper airway\nswelling can rapidly lead to airway obstruction and death, securing the airway\nwith an endotracheal tube (0.5-1 mm internal diameter smaller than normal) is\nadvised in patients with major burns. Along with an intravenous anesthetic\nsuch as ketamine, the muscle relaxant succinylcholine is safe and often used in\nthe first 24 hours after a burn, but is contraindicated after 48 hours due to the\npossibility of a hyperkalemia-induced cardiac arrest. In some cases, a sedated\nfiberoptic intubation may be required. If bronchospasm develops from the\naspiration of burned material or gastric contents, then bronchodilators as well\nas suctioning and fiberoptic evaluation of the airway may be needed.\nIn addition, prolonged entrapment in a fire area can lead to high carbon\nmonoxide (CO) levels, with resultant tissue hypoxia. Detection of high CO\nlevels may not be obvious because standard pulse oximeters read CO as\noxygen. Blood samples analyzed in a blood gas laboratory are required for\ndetection of CO. High-inspired oxygen concentrations are often required to\nprevent tissue hypoxia, as well as to reduce the half-life of CO in the blood.\nThe half-life of CO is 4 hours when breathing room air, 60 to 90 minutes when\nbreathing 100% oxygen, and 20 to 30 minutes in a hyperbaric chamber\nbreathing 100% oxygen at 2 to 3 atm of pressure.

    "explanation": "The most frequent immediate cause of death from fires is carbon monoxide\ntoxicity. Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless gas that exerts its adverse\neffects by decreasing O2 delivery to peripheral tissues. This is accomplished by\ntwo mechanisms. First, because the affinity of carbon monoxide for the O2\nbinding sites on hemoglobin is more than 200 times that of O2 , O2 is readily\ndisplaced from hemoglobin. Thus O2 content is reduced. Second, carbon\nmonoxide causes a leftward shift of the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve,\nwhich increases the affinity of hemoglobin for O2 at peripheral tissues.\nTreatment of carbon monoxide toxicity is administration of 100% O2 .\nSupplemental oxygen decreases the half-time of carboxyhemoglobin from 4 to\n6 hours with room air to about 1 hour with 100% oxygen.

In\none-lung ventilation, deliberate or accidental, blood exiting the ventilated side\nof the lungs (the right side in this question) is also essentially fully saturated,\nbut it mixes with nonoxygenated blood. The nonoxygenated blood has\neffectively bypassed the lungs by passing through an area that is perfused but\nnot ventilated, that is, a shunt. When the blood from the ventilated lung (nearly\n100% oxygenated) mixes with the shunted blood, a mixture will be formed that\nhas saturation less than 100%, but higher than the mixed venous O2 saturation.\nwhere Svo 2 = mixed venous hemoglobin saturation and Sao 2 = arterial oxygen\nsaturation\nO2 content = 1.39 × [Hgb] × SaO 2 + (0.003 × PaO 2 )\nThe exact saturation of the arterial blood in this question depends on the ratio\nof blood exiting the right lung versus that exiting the left lung. Fortunately,\nduring one-lung ventilation, the nonventilated lung collapses and in so doing\nraises its resistance to blood flow. This results in preferentially directing blood\nto the right ventilated lung. A second factor to consider is how well-saturated\nthe shunted blood is. “Red” blood from the right lung mixes with “blue” blood\nfrom the left lung to give a mixture of partially saturated blood. The saturation\nof the shunted “blue” blood depends on the hemoglobin concentration and\ncardiac output. From the first equation above, you can see that raising either of\nthese would improve the mixed venous oxygen saturation and ultimately the\narterial saturation during one-lung ventilation. Inflating the pulmonary artery\ncatheter balloon located in the nonventilated (left) lung would also improve\narterial saturation by limiting blood flow to the left lung. Raising the Fio 2 from\n80% to 100% will do little if anything to improve arterial saturation, because\nthe blood exiting the “working” lung is already fully saturated. The small rise\nin Pao 2 that would result from an increase in Fio 2 , once multiplied by 0.003\n(see the second equation above), would be a very small and insignificant\nnumber. In other words, raising Fio 2 does not improve arterial saturation in the\npresence of a shunt (Miller: Miller’s Anesthesia, ed 8, p 1386; Barash:\nClinical Anesthesia, ed 8, pp 374–375, 720)."

    "explanation": "The difference between the Paco 2 and the CO2 value measured by the\ninfrared spectrometer is a function of the patient’s physiologic dead space.\nPhysiologic dead space is equal to anatomic dead space plus alveolar dead\nspace. Anatomic dead space is roughly 1 mL/lb of body weight. Because\nanatomic dead space is relatively “fixed,” changes in physiologic dead space\nare mainly attributable to changes in alveolar dead space. Alveoli that are\nventilated, but not perfused, add to alveolar dead space. In essence, air goes\ninto these alveoli but does not participate in gas exchanges and merely exits the\nalveoli upon exhalation. Ventilation of dead space serves no useful purpose but\ndoes result in “dilution” of the exhaled CO2 , thus explaining why the CO2\nseen on the infrared spectrometer can be substantially lower than that obtained\nfrom arterial blood gas analysis. Several factors increase dead space, including\nlung diseases such as COPD, cystic fibrosis, and pulmonary emboli. In\naddition, decreased alveolar perfusion from low cardiac output or hypovolemia\nmay also contribute to increased dead space. Mainstem intubation, atelectasis,\nshunting through thebesian veins, and ablation of hypoxic pulmonary\nvasoconstriction by isoflurane are various causes of shunting. Shunting is also\na mismatch between ventilation and perfusion, but, in contrast to\nmismatch from dead space ventilation, shunting results in a normal or nearly\nnormal Paco 2 but a larger-than-expected A– a O2 gradient. The only choice in\nthis question that would explain an increase in dead space ventilation is\nhypovolemia (Barash: Clinical Anesthesia, ed 8, pp 373–374)."

    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "explanation": "Capnography has been a valuable monitor for the cardiac and pulmonary\nsystems, as well as for checking the anesthetic equipment. Forgetting to\nventilate the patient, intubating the esophagus, and having the sensing tube\nbecome disconnected from the monitor quickly will show no CO2 detected.\nAny significant reduction in lung perfusion (i.e., air embolism, decreased\ncardiac output, or decreased blood pressure) increases alveolar dead space and\nleads to a lowering of the detected CO2 . A cardiac arrest where there is no\nblood flow to the lungs and hence no carbon dioxide going to the lungs would\nalso result in no detectable CO2 . As CPR is started, detectable CO2 would be\na sign of lung perfusion and ventilation. A patient with a pneumothorax and\nhigh airway pressures would still give you CO2 readings (Barash: Clinical\nAnesthesia, ed 8, pp 711–712) ."

    "question": "A 30-year-old woman has undergone a 2-hour abdominal surgical procedure\nand is sent to the ICU intubated for postoperative monitoring, due to suspected\nsepsis. Three hours later, the ventilator malfunctions and the resident\ndisconnects the patient from the ventilator and hand ventilates the patient with\n100% oxygen. The patient has good bilateral breath sounds, the chest rises\nnicely, and moisture is seen in the ETT. Shortly thereafter, the patient’s heart\nrate slows to 30 beats/min and the blood pressure is 50 mm Hg systolic. The\nnext intervention that should be done, in addition to chest compressions, is",
    "options": [
      "Administer atropine",
      "Start epinephrine",
      "Confirm ETT position",
      "Apply external pacemaker"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "Always confirm an adequate Airway and Breathing before treating a\nCardiac rhythm (A, B before C). Having the ETT in proper position for several\nhours does not ensure that it remains in proper position. In this case the ETT\nslipped out of the trachea and went into the esophagus. The only way you\nknow the ETT is in the trachea is to see the tube passing between the vocal\ncords directly with a conventional laryngoscope or by putting a fiberoptic\nbronchoscope through the tube and seeing carina. Other forms of confirmation\nsuch as bilateral breath sounds, adequate chest rise, and moisture in the tube\nare helpful but could also be seen with an esophageal intubation. Getting a\nconsistent and adequate end tidal CO2 on a monitor confirms some gas\nexchange, but in cases where blood does not get to the lungs, as in a cardiac\narrest, CO2 cannot be removed from the lungs. The first part in the treatment\nof bradycardia is adequate ventilation with oxygen. After that the other choices\nmay be indicated (Miller: Miller’s Anesthesia, ed 8, p 1654; Barash: Clinical\nAnesthesia, ed 8, p 1247) ."
